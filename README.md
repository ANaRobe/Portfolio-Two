This To Do App was designed as a tool to create an overview of User's tasks helping to stay organised and increase productivity.

Therefore, the User will be able to stay more focused having an outline of what things has to do and the ones which are already already completed. 
Having tasks written in a list frees up space in user's mind and allows many more other benefits to come in place like improved memory and increased motivation.

This application contains 2 parts: 
- Intro Screen 
- Input Area.

Requirements for the project is that the Application  has to be interactive and responsive using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
